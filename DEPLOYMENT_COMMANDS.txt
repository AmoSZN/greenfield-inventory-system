EXACT DEPLOYMENT STEPS - WHAT I WOULD DO RIGHT NOW
====================================================

1. OPEN POWERSHELL AS ADMINISTRATOR
   - Right-click PowerShell â†’ Run as Administrator

2. NAVIGATE TO PROJECT
   cd "C:\Users\mattm\OneDrive\Greenfield Metal Sales\Barcode Scanner"

3. RUN PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECK
   .\PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.bat
   
   Expected output:
   - All 5 checks should pass
   - If NSSM missing, it will auto-download

4. INSTALL AS WINDOWS SERVICE
   .\install_as_service.bat
   
   This will:
   - Stop any existing service
   - Install "GreenfieldLabelService"
   - Set to auto-start on boot
   - Start the service immediately

5. VERIFY SERVICE IS RUNNING
   Get-Service GreenfieldLabelService
   
   Should show: Status = Running

6. TEST THE SERVICE
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5001/test-print"
   
   Should print a test label

7. CHECK SERVICE LOGS
   Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source GreenfieldLabelService -Newest 10

8. SET UP MONITORING (Run in separate PowerShell)
   while ($true) {
       $status = Get-Service GreenfieldLabelService
       Write-Host "$(Get-Date -Format 'HH:mm:ss') - Service: $($status.Status)"
       Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
   }

THAT'S IT - SYSTEM IS DEPLOYED!
