DO THESE 3 THINGS RIGHT NOW!
============================================================

THING 1: Find Your Paradigm Password
------------------------------------
Type: python test_paradigm_auth.py
Press: n (to use current credentials)

If it says "User Not Authorized":
- Go to https://greenfieldapi.para-apps.com
- Try logging in with your normal username/password
- Use THAT username/password in the test

Keep trying until it says "SUCCESS!"


THING 2: Get Ngrok (5 minutes)
------------------------------
Type: .\QUICK_START.ps1
Press: 8
Press: Enter

A black window will open with a web address.
COPY THAT ADDRESS! (looks like: https://abc123.ngrok.io)


THING 3: Add Webhook in Paradigm (5 minutes)
--------------------------------------------
1. Open Paradigm in your web browser
2. Look for: Settings or Admin or Configuration
3. Find: Webhooks or Integrations or API
4. Click: Add New or Create Webhook
5. Fill in:
   Name: Label Printer
   URL: [your ngrok address]/paradigm-webhook
   Type: SalesOrder
   Method: POST
6. Save it!

DONE! Create an order and watch it print!

============================================================
NEED HELP?
- Your label printer IS working (we tested it)
- You just need the right Paradigm login
- Ngrok is like call forwarding for computers
- The webhook tells Paradigm where to send orders
